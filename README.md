# Mental Health as a Function of Music - Data Mining 

An exploratory research to find any correlation between a listener's preference in music and their mental health.

Python and Spotipy (Python Spotify Web Wrapper) were used to create the data mining models and to retrieve song information from Spotify's Web API.

## Data Collection

The primary data was collected through a survey that asked surveyers to list their 3 favourite songs at the moment and to rate their mental health using a likert scale on the following topics:

- ability to enjoy life
- resilience
- balanced lifestyle
- emotional flexibility
- self-actualization

These questions are described as good indicators of an individual's mental health by the [Canadian Mental Health Association](www.cmha.ca/mental_health/mental-health-meter/).

Once the survey had more than 300 entries (and approximately 1000 songs), a Python script was made to fetch data from the Spotify's music catalog using Spotify Web API. The  [Get Audio Features for a Track](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-audio-features/) endpoint was used to retrieve song information in a JSON format. An example of this JSON output is shown below for a song.

<b>"Starboy - The Weeknd ft. Daft Punk"</b>

For the purposes of this study, only the following features were retrieved: 

| Feature  | Definition by Spotify  |
|:-:|---|
| Energy |Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. |
| Danceability | Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.  |
| Valence  |  A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).  |
| Tempo  | The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration. |
| Popularity  | The popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.  |
| Instrumentalness  | 	Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.  |
|  Acousticness | 	A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.  |
| Liveness  | Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live. |

Once the data was collected, it was cleaned to ensure that there were no missing fields. Furthermore, each listener's total mental health score was calculated as a sum of the individual mental health answers and an average of their musical properties were taken to reflect the listener's overall musical behaviour. 

Now that all the data has been collected and cleaned, time to get into the more interesting material!
